(just to preface i use will and desire kind of interchangeably in this so when you see them, just know they're the same thing.)

**Sixth sense Anchors**

**anchors** can be described as someone's will. or more specifically, someone's desire. This let's [[Sixth senses.canvas\|Sixth senses]] enter and stay within this world.

they are either materialized when the desire of a sixth sense is strong. this causes an anchor to materialize in our dimension all by itself, with no direct host. 

This allows the sixth sense to form on our dimension, and allows them to form however they'd like. which will give them the title of an [[Magic systems/sixthsense general info/independent sixth sense\|independent sixth sense]] it could be any desire. the desire to have form, the desire to live a comfortable life, the desire to be free.

Sixth sense anchors are slightly egg shaped.
They can be seen, felt, touched, and destroyed.
the color can be anything but black or white.
they're usually gold unless they are especially powerful.
black and white are reserved for [[SIXTHSENSES/REVUN\|REVUN]]

Person Anchors

person anchors are materialized by the will of a person, which will give that person a [[Magic systems/sixthsense general info/dependent sixth sense\|dependent sixth sense]] these cannot be seen as a soul stays within a persons body.

everyone in our universe born with a soul a soul, which means everyone has an anchor.  just because you have an anchor does not necessarily lock you into getting a sixth sense. plenty of people live their entire lives without wanting or getting a sixth sense.






IS everything alive?? tree in Neo O'Rourke that protects stuff??
i guess you can argue that it also has an anchor. the tree wanted to protect that object so bad(sixth sense crystal) or maybe. the sixth sense crystal wanted to protect itself so bad it latched onto whatever energy it could (the tree) and used it as it's anchor. even if there was barely any usable will in the tree.
