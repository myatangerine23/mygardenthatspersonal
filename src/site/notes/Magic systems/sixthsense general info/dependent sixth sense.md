Dependant sixth senses are Sixth senses that are dependent on their host's [[Magic systems/sixthsense general info/anchors\|anchor]].  . they gain all of their energy from their user, and their user must care for their body in order to use their sixth sense effectively

sidenote dependent sixth senses die with their owners BUT if their will is so strong after their owners' death (EX: unjustified death, sixth sense wants to carry on owner's mission,, etc.) then the sixth sense creates their own anchor & lives on from there.

however a dependent sixth sense turning into a independent sixth sense will always be weaker than sixth senses who started out independent. and most times, they end up turning [[Magic systems/extended sixth sense stuff/berserk sixth senses\|berserk]]

they also have a very. very hazy memory, often times not remembering how they became independent unless they're very strong.w
