[[Magic systems/sixthsense general info/sixth senses\|sixth senses]] are a By-Product of the [[Magic systems/extended sixth sense stuff/SDED\|SDED]], they are the physical culmination of sixth-dimensional energy latching onto an anchor and making that 

It ranges from Guns, Electricity out of your finger to entire beings that live within your head (EX: Okra, Moon), or the more severe cases, becoming an entire element.




==(There have been cases where a sixth sense was too strong for a person's body, an example would be somebody who's touched a Sixth sense Crystal, their insides turned into fire, they weren't hurt by this, however, they died due to starvation since everything they ate got burnt.)==




nowadays, people who have such strong abilities, or do not want their sixth sense, wear null-crystals to live.

sixth senses are usually only obtained when a person actually wants it.. its  not materialized  by a persons will, at alll./ they need to either touch a sixth sense crystal or accept an independent(or berserk) sixth sense as their own


That is the scary part of wanting to get a sixth sense. If you get a sixth sense crystal you are essentially gambling with what you could get in return.
